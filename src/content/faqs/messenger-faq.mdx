  - question: "What is a Facebook Messenger bot?"
    answer: "A Facebook Messenger bot is a series of automated interactions designed to address common inquiries from your customers via Messenger. It can explain your product or service, collect customer information, provide valuable content, or guide potential customers toward making a purchase."
  - question: "What can a bot do for my business?"
    answer: "Our bots can automatically greet new users, deliver content, schedule messages, respond to specific keywords, and much more to enhance your customer engagement."
  - question: "Why do I need a Messenger bot?"
    answer: "Reaching your audience is becoming increasingly challenging. With fewer people opening emails and social media being oversaturated, your organic reach might drop below 10%. Facebook Messenger bots address this issue by facilitating personalized and automated conversations with your customers, offering real-time interaction and boasting an impressive 80% open rate."
  - question: "How do I create a Messenger bot?"
    answer: "To create a Messenger bot, you need an active Facebook Page and administrative access to manage it. Simply click the 'Get Started' button at the top of the page to begin. Although a Facebook Page is necessary to start, your Zapify bot can engage customers beyond just that platform. You can launch your bot and initiate conversations wherever customers can click a linkâ€”whether on your website, in an email, or via a QR code."
